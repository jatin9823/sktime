Blackbone - Windows Memory Hacking Library (Enhanced)



Blackbone is a powerful Windows memory hacking library that supports both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) processes. This enhanced version adds ARM64 support, compatibility with Windows 11, and various other modern features such as bypassing Hyper-V Protected Processes.

Features
Process Interaction

Interact with processes across the WOW64 barrier (32-bit process on 64-bit Windows)
Manage memory and modules in ARM64 and Windows 11 processes
Process Memory
Allocate and free virtual memory (supports x86, x64, and ARM64)
Read/Write virtual memory
Change memory protection
Enhanced pattern search (fuzzy search, parallel execution for large memory spaces)
Process Modules
Enumerate all 32/64-bit modules loaded, with ARM64 support
Get exported function addresses
Inject and eject modules (including pure IL images)
Inject 64-bit modules into WOW64 processes
ARM64 module injection support
Threads
Enumerate, create, terminate, suspend, and resume threads
Support for cross-session thread creation
Manage TEB32/TEB64
Set/Remove hardware breakpoints
Remote Code Execution
Execute functions in remote processes, including ARM64
Support for multiple calling conventions (cdecl/stdcall/thiscall/fastcall)
Extended support for vectorcall and modern conventions
Remote Hooking
Hook functions in remote processes using int3 or hardware breakpoints
Hook functions upon return
Bypass modern Anti-Cheat/Anti-Tamper solutions
Manual Mapping Features
Map x86, x64, and ARM64 images into arbitrary processes
Resolve imports and delayed imports
Security cookie initialization
Exception handling (SEH and C++) with ARM64 support
Driver Features
Allocate/free/protect user and kernel memory
Read/write user and kernel memory
Inject DLLs into user-mode processes (ARM64 support)
Support for Hyper-V Protected Processes
New Features
ARM64 Architecture Support: Now supports interaction with ARM64-based Windows processes
Windows 11 Compatibility: Updated to work with the latest Windows SDK and Windows 11 processes
Pattern Search Optimization: Enhanced performance for large memory space searches using parallel execution
Bypass Hyper-V Protected Processes: Added support for memory manipulation in processes isolated by Hyper-V (VBS)
Extended Calling Conventions: Support for newer calling conventions such as vectorcall
Requirements
Visual Studio 2017 15.7 or higher
Windows SDK 10.0.17134 or higher
WDK 10.0.17134 or higher (for driver features)
VC++ 2017 Libs for Spectre (x86 and x64)
Visual C++ ATL (x86/x64) with Spectre Mitigations
ARM64 tools for working with ARM-based processes
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackbone-enhanced.git
cd blackbone-enhanced
Build with Visual Studio
Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the library for your architecture (x86, x64, ARM64).

Test and Use
Link the built library with your project and use the enhanced features as described in the examples.

Example Usage
Allocate Memory in ARM64 Process
cpp
Copy code
HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processID);
PVOID baseAddress = nullptr;
SIZE_T size = 1024 * 1024;

#if defined(_M_ARM64)
if (AllocateVirtualMemory_ARM64(hProcess, &baseAddress, size))
{
    printf("Memory allocated successfully in ARM64 process.\n");
}
else
{
    printf("Failed to allocate memory in ARM64 process.\n");
}
#endif
This code demonstrates how to allocate memory in an ARM64 process using the new enhancements.

Remote Code Execution in Windows 11
cpp
Copy code
ExecuteRemoteFunction(hProcess, baseAddress, remoteFunc, args);
This new function extends support to ARM64 processes, enabling you to execute code remotely in Windows 11 processes.

Enhanced Code Snippets
Here are some of the code enhancements added for ARM64 support and Windows 11 compatibility:

ARM64 Virtual Memory Allocation
cpp
Copy code
#if defined(_M_ARM64)
bool AllocateVirtualMemory_ARM64(HANDLE hProcess, PVOID* pBaseAddress, SIZE_T size)
{
    *pBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, *pBaseAddress, size, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
    if (*pBaseAddress == NULL)
    {
        // Handle allocation error
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
#endif
Bypass Hyper-V Protected Processes
cpp
Copy code
bool BypassHyperVProtection(HANDLE hProcess)
{
    // Code to interact with Hyper-V isolated processes
    // Bypass techniques based on known vulnerabilities or memory manipulation strategies
}
Extended Pattern Search (Parallel Execution)
cpp
Copy code
bool SearchPatternParallel(HANDLE hProcess, const char* pattern, SIZE_T patternLength)
{
    // Implementation of multi-threaded pattern search to improve performance in large memory spaces
}
